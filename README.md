This project is concerned with determining the stock keeping unit (SKU) of products. 

Description: A firm produces many products but has limited storage space. Hence they need to produce just the right amount of a particular product at any time, based on how much of that product they sell on average in a day, (the Average Daily Sales - ADS), and their level of certainty that they will sell that product (the Coefficient of Variation - CV).

Task: To advise the firm on what products to produce to stock and what products to produce only when orders are made


================== RESULTS =============================
From the result, there are 3 clusters (categories), 
1) Products with high average daily sale and low variation. 
Advice: These should be made to stock

2) Products with low average daily sales and high variation.
Advice: These should be made to order

3) Products with high average daily sales and high variation.
Advice: These products make a lower fraction, and should be made on a case-by-case bases
